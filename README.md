# De Novo

## Goals

- Make early game BTW more survivable, without killing all challenge, by introducing more mechanics like fishing that are tedious
- Support survival in skyblock, survival island seeds, single biome maps for any biome type and flatmaps without structures
- Allow progression on a survival island with no trees or animals up to crafting a boat
- Allow progression in the nether from nothing to nether portal
- Allow survival on a map with nothing but a bedrock plane (truly from nothing or De Novo), using starter chest
